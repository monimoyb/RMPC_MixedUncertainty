# Robust MPC for Linear Systems with Parametric and Additive Uncertainty: A Novel Constraint Tightening Approach 

These set of codes replicate the Region of Attraction (ROA) and the computation times presented in the draft https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00930. The blue set denotes the ROA from our method, which is bigger than the corresponding ROAs from Tube MPC (red set, www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005109803002838?via%3Dihub, Section 5), and System level Synthesis based Constrained LQR (yellow set, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.10121.pdf, Section 2.3).
